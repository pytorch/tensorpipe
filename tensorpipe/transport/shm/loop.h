  // Interaction with epoll(7).
  //
  // A dedicated thread runs epoll_wait(2) in a loop and, every time it returns,
  // it defers a function to the reactor which is responsible for processing the
  // epoll events and executing the handlers, and then notify the epoll thread
  // that it is done, for it to start another iteration. This back-and-forth
  // between these threads is done to ensure that all epoll handlers are run
  // from the reactor thread, just like everything else. Doing so makes it
  // easier to reason about how certain events are sequenced. For example, if
  // another processes first makes a write to a connection and then closes the
  // accompanying Unix domain socket, we know for a fact that the reactor will
  // first react to the write, and then react to the epoll event caused by
  // closing the socket. If we didn't force serialization onto the reactor, we
  // would not have this guarantee.
  //
  // It's safe to call epoll_ctl from one thread while another thread is blocked
  // on an epoll_wait call. This means that the kernel internally serializes the
  // operations on a single epoll fd. However, we have no way to control whether
  // a modification of the set of file descriptors monitored by epoll occurred
  // just before or just after the return from the epoll_wait. This means that
  // when we start processing the result of epoll_wait we can't know what set of
  // file descriptors it operated on. This becomes a problem if, for example, in
  // between the moment epoll_wait returns and the moment we process the results
  // a file descriptor is unregistered and closed and another one with the same
  // value is opened and registered: we'd end up calling the handler of the new
  // fd for the events of the old one (which probably include errors).
  //
  // However, epoll offers a way to address this: epoll_wait returns, for each
  // event, the piece of extra data that was provided by the *last* call on
  // epoll_ctl for that fd. This allows us to detect whether epoll_wait had
  // taken into account an update to the set of fds or not. We do so by giving
  // each update a unique identifier, called "record". Each update to a fd will
  // associate a new record to it. The handlers are associated to records (and
  // not to fds), and for each fd we know which handler is the one currently
  // installed. This way when processing an event we can detect whether the
  // record for that event is still valid or whether it is stale, in which case
  // we disregard the event, and wait for it to fire again at the next epoll
  // iteration, with the up-to-date handler.
