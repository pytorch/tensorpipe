// Channels are an out of band mechanism to transfer data between
// processes. Examples include a direct address space to address space
// memory copy on the same machine, or a GPU-to-GPU memory copy.
//
// Construction of a channel happens as follows.
//
//   1) During initialization of a pipe, the connecting peer sends its
//      list of channel contexts and their domain descriptors. The
//      domain descriptor is used to determine whether or not a
//      channel can be used by a pair of peers.
//   2) The listening side of the pipe compares the list it received
//      its own list to determine the list of channels should be used
//      for the peers.
//   3) For every channel that should be constructed, the listening
//      side registers a slot with its low level listener. These slots
//      uniquely identify inbound connections on this listener (by
//      sending a word-sized indentifier immediately after connecting)
//      and can be used to construct new connections. These slots are
//      sent to the connecting side of the pipe, which then attempts
//      to establish a new connection for every token.
//   4) At this time, we have a new control connection for every
//      channel that is about to be constructed. Both sides of the
//      pipe can now create the channel instance using the newly
//      created connection. Further initialization that needs to
//      happen is defered to the channel implementation. We assume the
//      channel is usable from the moment it is constructed.
